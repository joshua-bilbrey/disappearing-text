# Disappearing Text App
A desktop app that makes the text you are typing disappear if you stop typing before the time is up.

You can set various time limits for the writing session, but you have to write the entire time (backspaces do not count) or after 5 seconds your work will be lost. 

The application is scaleable, so it should work on any computer.
